This is USB device driver for IKA Logic LCD Logic Combo.
http://ikalogicstore.com/index.php?id_product=17&controller=product

I made it on Ubuntu13.04(kernel3.8.0).
It is based on usb-skeleton.c in kernel source.

How to use:

#make
#insmod ikalcd.ko
#echo -n "foobar" >/dev/ikalcd0

"foobar" is showed on the LCD.
You can also control the LCD by sending commands.
For example:

#echo -en "\x11\x65\x80" >/dev/ikalcd0

This sets up the brigntness of the LCD backligt.
See datasheet for more details.
